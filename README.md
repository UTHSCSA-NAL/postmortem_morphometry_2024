# Overview
Postmortem image processing pipeline. 
To gain some space, only five downsampled OASIS-TRT atlases are provided. The other atlases can be downloaded from [1,2].

## Requirements

- Singularity (https://sylabs.io/docs/)
- SLURM workload manager (https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html)

## Building the containers

Go into the "containers" folder and execute the "containers_preparation.sh" script
```
cd containers
./containers_preparation.sh
```
